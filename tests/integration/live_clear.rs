//! What IRIS actually sends for `W #`, and what the grid does with it.
//!
//! Ignored by default — it needs an installed, running instance. Run with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test integration live_clear:: -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Read-only: it writes `W #` to the device and nothing else. No login, no
//! data, no globals touched.
//!
//! The point of the test is the regression behind it. `W #` clears the screen
//! in place, and blanking those rows where they stood lost the transcript with
//! them: there was nothing to scroll back to, unlike the native IrisTerm.
