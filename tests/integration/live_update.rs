//! What GitHub actually answers, and whether the download really arrives.
//!
//! Ignored by default — both tests need the network, and the second one moves
//! twelve megabytes over it. Run with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test integration live_update:: -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Read-only against the repository: one API call and one asset download into
//! a temporary directory. Nothing is installed and the running executable is
//! never touched.
//!
//! The point of the tests is the regression behind them: the update checked
//! successfully and then never downloaded. Two separate things were wrong, and
//! only running this on the network in question told them apart.
//!
//! The first was a deadline. `AgentBuilder::timeout` covers "the overall
//! request, including ... reading the response body", so the twenty seconds
//! meant for a small JSON call were also the entire budget for fetching a
//! twelve-megabyte executable — anything slower than about 600 KB/s was cut
//! off partway through.
//!
//! The second is the one this machine actually hits, and it is not the app's
//! fault: GitHub serves release assets from `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`,
//! and the Squid here answers `407` for that host while letting
//! `api.github.com` through anonymously. So the check works and the download
//! cannot, until the proxy is given credentials. Both failures used to be
//! swallowed — the dialog just showed its Download button again, which reads
//! as a button that does nothing.
