//! Whether a shell plugin really opens a shell.
//!
//! Ignored by default — it starts a process on this machine. Run with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test integration live_shell:: -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Harmless: it opens each shell in turn, asks it to echo one word, and kills
//! it. Nothing is written anywhere - the shell files themselves are written by
//! the app, not by this.
//!
//! The point of the test is that everything the app does with a shell it
//! already did with IRIS — a pseudo-terminal, a child, a reader thread — and
//! the only new part is the command. That part cannot be checked without
//! starting one: a wrong argument, or a `chcp` wrapper that swallows the
//! program, comes out as a tab that opens and immediately ends.
