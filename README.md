# newIrisTerminal 🖥️

A terminal emulator for InterSystems IRIS — Windows, Linux and macOS.

## 📖 Overview

**newIrisTerminal** drives IRIS sessions through a real pseudo-terminal. Built in Rust with egui. Interface in English and Brazilian Portuguese.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Terminal zoom:** Ctrl + mouse wheel over a terminal pane increases or decreases the font size, using the same 8–28 point range as Ctrl+Plus/Minus. Trackpad pinch gestures also adjust the font proportionally when the platform delivers native pinch events (macOS), or through the same Ctrl + wheel path on drivers that emulate it. Scrolling without Ctrl keeps navigating the transcript.

* **Tabs:** one IRIS session per tab, each with its own scrollback and log.
  Ctrl+T connects on the last-used server; right-click `+` for every profile,
  server and discovered instance. A tab is named after its instance and, if you
  like, the namespace the session is in — `CONSISTEM | RDB76-TR` — following
  every `ZN`.
* **Split panes:** *Split to right* or *Split to bottom* opens a second session
  in the same tab. Drag the divider to resize, double-click it to even them out.
  Each pane sizes its own session, so neither is truncated at a width it is not
  drawn at.
* **Lines far longer than the window:** the terminal reports a right margin of
  16384 columns, so a `zwrite` of a wide global arrives whole and a long command
  is echoed whole. The window is a view onto the line, wrapped or scrolled
  sideways.
* **ObjectScript colouring:** globals, strings, macros, class and method
  references, routine and extrinsic calls, commands and their IRIS
  abbreviations. Prompt-aware, so plain prose never lights up.
* **Line editing at the prompt:** Home/End, Ctrl+Left/Right by word, click to
  place the cursor, Ctrl+A to select, double-click for a word, triple-click for
  a line. Built entirely from keys IRIS acts on, since IRIS owns the read
  buffer. Typing `"`, `'`, `(`, `[` or `{` over a selection wraps it in the pair
  instead of replacing it, the way an editor does — so a global name picked off
  the screen is quoted in one keystroke.
* **Find in the transcript:** Ctrl+F searches everything the session has
  printed, scrollback included. Enter and Shift+Enter — or F3 — walk the hits,
  every one is highlighted, and the view scrolls to the one being looked at.
* **Command history that outlives the session:** Up offers a tab the commands
  typed at its own prompt first, then the ones earlier runs left behind. Lines a
  macro sent are never offered back.
* **SQL mode:** type `/sql` at an IRIS prompt (or press Ctrl+Shift+Q) to drop
  into the IRIS SQL shell; the same gesture leaves it. While the prompt reads
  `NAMESPACE>>`, the line is coloured as SQL.
* **Autocomplete at the prompt:** commands, `$` functions, `^` globals,
  routines, `##class(` names and, in SQL mode, keywords and tables. Globals
  come from the namespace itself — mapped ones and `^mtemp…` in IRISTEMP
  included — and a prefix with too many is folded into one line per next
  letter (`^TG…`) that narrows as you type. Inside `^GLOBAL(` it names the
  subscript from the global's documentation and offers its constants, its
  listed values and the subscripts that exist there now. Up/Down choose, Tab
  accepts, Esc closes.
* **Macros from XML:** `{{param}}` substitution, `confirm="true"` for anything
  that writes, a keyboard shortcut per macro, and `hide_command="true"` for a
  command line carrying a password. The macro editor checks every parameter
  against the command, and one the command never uses is not asked for.
* **IRIS utilities:** compile a package, compile a routine group, generate an
  interface — each with a field per argument and the exact line it will send
  shown underneath.
* **Other shells:** Command Prompt, Windows PowerShell, PowerShell 7, Git Bash,
  WSL, or whatever `/etc/shells` lists. Each is a `.toml` in `plugins/shells/`,
  written there the first time the app finds it installed and yours to edit or
  delete after that.
* **A clear-screen that keeps the transcript:** `W #` files the old screen into
  scrollback instead of destroying it, the way the native IrisTerm does.
  Ctrl+Delete is the deliberate gesture that really throws it away.
* **Themes you can edit in the app:** ten built-in and immutable — IRIS
  Dark, IRIS Classic Green, Tokyo, Light, Tiger Aqua, Tiger Graphite, Windows
  XP, Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty Dark and Final Fantasy VII.
  Duplicate one and every colour is yours: the terminal, its scrollbar and the
  chrome (each with an optional gradient), the window buttons, the selected
  tab, the sixteen ANSI slots and the sixteen ObjectScript ones. Point at a
  swatch and press Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V to copy a colour between elements. The
  title bar's layout is the theme's too: drag its items into any order, with a
  left and a right space to pack things left, right or centred.
* **Settings with search:** one window, macOS/GNOME style — a sidebar of
  pages, the themes, macros and screen savers among them, and a search field
  that finds any setting by name or description, in English or Portuguese.
  An interface scale from 100% to 200% enlarges everything but the terminal,
  and a title bar scale enlarges the tabs and the title bar on top of it.
* **Tabs and the title bar:** the tabs share the whole bar, and any of them,
  or any button, moves the window when dragged up or down. With *Close to the
  tray* on, launching the app again brings the running copy back instead of
  starting a second one.
* **Screen savers:** Matrix (in any colours), a bouncing DVD logo or your own
  text, and a floating logo — Windows XP, Windows XP Pirated Edition, your text
  or your own PNG/GIF.
* **Export and logging:** screen or full scrollback, as text or
  colour-preserving HTML, to a file or the clipboard. Per-session transcripts
  are written through as the session runs, with password redaction and rotation.
* **Analyze with Claude:** opens a Claude Code session with the terminal output
  already in its context, then waits for your question. Four scopes: all
  output, the last 10 commands, the last 5, or just the selection. Needs
  `claude` on the PATH.
* **Autologon:** credentials from the OS credential store, never from
  `settings.toml`.
* **Auto-update:** checks GitHub for a newer release at startup, through the
  machine's own proxy. Nothing is downloaded or replaced without being asked.

## 🧾 Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10 or later, Linux, or macOS
- **Disk:** ~30 MB free space
- An InterSystems IRIS or Caché instance to connect to — local instances are
  discovered automatically via `iris list`

## Setup

- [ ] Grab the latest build from the [releases page](https://github.com/ccsJoaoAzevedo/newIrisTerminal/releases).
- [ ] Run the executable — there is no installer and nothing is written outside
      the config directory.
- [ ] Pick a theme and a font in Settings, and add a profile for any server you
      connect to that is not a local instance.

## Configuration

Everything lives under the platform config directory —
`%APPDATA%\newIrisTerminal`, `~/.config/newIrisTerminal`, or
`~/Library/Application Support/newIrisTerminal`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `settings.toml` | Language, theme, font, window, session and logging settings, and the profiles |
| `macros.xml` | Your personal macros — written by the macro manager |
| `history.txt` | Commands typed at an IRIS prompt, for recall |
| `themes/*.toml` | Your own themes, written by the theme manager |
| `analysis/*.md` | Output handed to Claude Code by *Analyze with Claude* |
| `plugins/shells/*.toml` | One per shell, found or declared |

Passwords are never in `settings.toml`: they go to the OS credential store
(Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Secret Service), keyed by profile
name — and the HTTP proxy's password with them, under `http-proxy`.

### Encoding

A session has one character set, used to decode what arrives and to encode what
is typed, and nothing translates a second time in between.

**A local session is UTF-8, and there is nothing to choose.** Sessions are
opened with `chcp 65001` in front of them, which is the only configuration in
which accented text works in both directions.

**A Telnet session is where the codepages are real**, because no console stands
in the path and the socket carries the instance's own bytes. UTF-8, CP850,
Windows-1252 and ISO 8859-1 are selectable per remote profile.

## Build from source

```sh
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

The plugin host pulls in wasmtime and is off by default:

```sh
cargo build --release --features plugins
```

On Windows without Visual Studio, the GNU toolchain needs a full MinGW-w64
beside it (the one inside the Rust MSI lacks the assembler `dlltool` wants):

```powershell
winget install Rustlang.Rust.GNU
winget install BrechtSanders.WinLibs.POSIX.MSVCRT
```

The tests that talk to a real instance are ignored by default; they open a
session and read the banner, never logging in and never writing data:

```sh
cargo test --test integration live_session:: -- --ignored --nocapture
```

`IRIS_TEST_INSTANCE` picks the instance; otherwise the first discovered one is
used.

## ⚠️ Safety note

Macros and the IRIS utilities type into a live session, and `RDB*` databases are
shared with the whole team. Any macro that modifies data should carry
`confirm="true"`: the terminal then shows the exact expanded text and requires
an explicit yes before sending.

## Versioning

[ZeroVer](https://0ver.org): the major version stays at zero. The updater
compares the numbers rather than the string, so `0.2.0` is newer than `0.1.9`.
