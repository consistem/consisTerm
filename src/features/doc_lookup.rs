//! Looking up a global's structure - its subscripts and the pieces of its
//! value - for the tooltip that describes one of them.
//!
//! The question is asked down a session of its own - see [`DocLookup`] - and
//! never down the one the user is looking at. Typing into that one was the
//! first design and it cannot be made safe: the decision that the prompt is
//! idle and the moment the bytes actually go out are separated by however
//! long it takes the session to next say something, and the user types in
//! between.
//!
//! The query asks for structure only - which piece is which property, its
//! size, its type, its value list - never for a specific record's value.
//! That is what makes the answer cacheable per `(namespace, global)`: the
//! first hover on a global is the only one that ever has to ask.
//!
//! `build_query`'s `ObjectScript` has been run against a live instance and
//! its shape is load-bearing - read that function's comment before
//! rearranging it.
