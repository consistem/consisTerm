//! Checking GitHub for a newer build, and swapping this one for it.
//!
//! The check is one HTTPS GET against the releases API, run on a thread of its
//! own at startup so a slow proxy cannot hold the first frame. Nothing is
//! downloaded and nothing is replaced without being asked: the app says a
//! version is available, and the user decides.
//!
//! Behind a corporate proxy this only works if it goes through it, so the
//! system's own proxy settings are read and used — on Windows from the same
//! registry keys Internet Options writes, elsewhere from the `HTTPS_PROXY` /
//! `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables.
//!
//! What the system cannot tell us is the *credentials*, and a proxy can want
//! them for the download while letting the check through: GitHub serves release
//! assets from a host of their own, and a Squid with per-host rules will answer
//! `407` for that one and pass `api.github.com` anonymously. That is why there
//! is a proxy user in the settings and a password in the credential store —
//! see `proxy_credentials` — and why a refusal now says which of the two it
//! was. Only Basic authentication: neither `ureq` nor the `curl.exe` Windows
//! ships can do NTLM, so a proxy that insists on it is one the app cannot get
//! past, and the dialog offers the browser instead.
//!
//! `tests/integration/live_update.rs` is where all of this is checked against the real
//! repository, and it is the only way any of it can be.
