//! Settings - with the theme editor among its pages - is the one you keep open
//! *while* watching the terminal: turning a switch on, or dragging a colour,
//! and looking at what it did. An `egui::Window` inside the app covers exactly
//! what you are trying to see, so it is an operating-system window instead. Nothing
//! else here is: the rest are either momentary (export, a confirmation) or
//! already beside the terminal rather than over it.
//!
//! They are drawn as *immediate* viewports, not deferred ones: the contents
//! borrow the app's settings and themes, and a deferred viewport's callback has
//! to be `'static + Send + Sync`, which nothing that edits live state can be.
//!
//! The frame is the app's own, drawn by [`crate::ui::chrome`] exactly as the
//! main window's is, and it follows the same "use the system title bar" setting.
