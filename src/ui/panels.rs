//! Side panels and dialogs: the IRIS utilities, settings, and the dialogs the
//! rest of the interface hands its questions to.
//!
//! These are pure-ish view functions — they render, and report back what the
//! user asked for as an [`UiRequest`], which `app.rs` then carries out. Keeping
//! the "decide" and "do" halves apart is what lets a destructive macro be
//! routed through a confirmation step without the panel knowing anything about
//! sessions.
//!
//! Three things used to live here and no longer do. Macros are managed on
//! the Macros page of Settings ([`crate::ui::settings_view::macros`]), and
//! run from the terminal's right-click menu; exporting and the IRIS utilities
//! are on that menu too, beside the output they act on. What is left of the
//! macros here is the confirmation step, which is the part that has to
//! interrupt.
