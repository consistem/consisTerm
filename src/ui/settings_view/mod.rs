//! The Settings window: a sidebar of categories with a search field, and a
//! page of cards for the category picked.
//!
//! Every row is declared once, in `pages`, with its title, its subtitle and
//! a few hidden keywords beside the code that draws its control. The page draws
//! from that list and so does the search, which is what keeps the two from
//! drifting apart: there is no second list of "things you can search for" to
//! forget to update, and a row added to a page is findable the moment it is.
//!
//! The categories are arranged by what someone opening the window is trying
//! to do - change how it looks, how a window behaves, how typing works, what a
//! session connects to - rather than by which part of the code reads the
//! setting. What is seldom needed on a page sits on a sub-page of its own,
//! reached from a row with a chevron, and named for what is on it.
//!
//! No OK or Cancel. Every change is applied the moment it is made, so it can
//! be judged against the terminal behind the window: a Cancel would be lying
//! about what it did.
//!
//! # The managers' pages
//!
//! Themes, Screen saver and Macros used to be windows of their own, opened
//! from here. They are pages now, in [`themes`], [`screensaver`] and
//! [`macros`], declared like every other: a list leads to a detail sub-page,
//! and a sub-page can lead to one of its own (`Page::parent`), with the way
//! back named for where it goes. What has to stay in view while the page
//! scrolls - a preview of the theme being edited, the screen saver's little
//! monitor - is the page's `top`, drawn between the header and the cards.
//!
//! A row that edits "the selected one" - a colour of the theme being edited,
//! a field of the open macro - is `contextual`: the search finds it like any
//! other, but in the results it is only a way to its page, since out there
//! nothing says which theme or macro its control would be changing.
