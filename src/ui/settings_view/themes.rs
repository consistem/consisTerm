//! The Themes pages: every theme as a thumbnail, and an editor for every
//! colour one carries.
//!
//! Themes were TOML files and nothing else, so changing a colour meant finding
//! the folder, editing hex by hand, and restarting. This is the same file
//! format with a front end on it - and the same distinction the loader makes:
//! the built-ins live in the binary and are immutable, so the first thing
//! anyone does here is duplicate one.
//!
//! The gallery is the category's page, with the theme it is on previewed at
//! the top. The editor is a sub-page, and each group of colours a sub-page of
//! that - one thing on screen per page, the grid, the frame round it, the
//! title bar's controls, the highlighting - with the same live preview fixed
//! above them, so a dragged swatch is judged against real-looking output in
//! the frame it is dragged.
//!
//! Edits land in the themes as they are made, so the terminal behind the
//! window repaints in the colour being dragged; only what has to reach the
//! disk or the settings goes out, as a [`ThemeAction`], so a theme cannot be
//! saved or deleted from inside a paint pass.
