//! The Macros pages: every macro there is, group by group, and an editor for
//! one of them on a sub-page of its own.
//!
//! Running macros is on the terminal's right-click menu, where the output
//! they are run against is; what is here is the managing. The list is a card
//! per group, the way the right-click menu arranges them, and a macro opens
//! onto its own page - General, Commands, Parameters and what it Will send -
//! with the way back to the list above it.
//!
//! Two kinds of macro, and the difference is the whole of the read-only half
//! of these pages: the organisation's file is shared and never written from
//! the app, so those are shown and can be copied but not changed. Only the
//! personal file is edited here, and only `UiRequest::SavePersonalMacros`
//! writes it.
