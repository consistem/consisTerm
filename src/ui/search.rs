//! Finding text in what a session has already printed.
//!
//! The transcript is the reason this terminal keeps a scrollback at all - a
//! `zwrite` from an hour ago is evidence - and until now the only way to look
//! through it was to export it and open the file in something else. Ctrl+F
//! searches it in place.
//!
//! The search runs over the grid, not over the raw bytes: what is looked
//! through is exactly what is on screen, so a match's position is a line and a
//! column that the renderer can highlight and the view can be scrolled to. That
//! also means a line IRIS cut at the right margin is searched as the cut line,
//! which is the honest answer - the rest of it never arrived.
//!
//! Deliberately free of egui, apart from [`bar`]: [`find`] is the part worth
//! testing, and it is testable only if it can be called without a window.
