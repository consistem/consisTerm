//! Shell plugins: the other command interpreters this machine has.
//!
//! A shell plugin is a declaration, not code — a name and a program to run —
//! which is what lets it be a plugin at all. The WebAssembly plugins next door
//! are sandboxed precisely so that they *cannot* start a process; a plugin that
//! opens PowerShell therefore cannot be one of those, and does not need to be.
//! There is nothing to execute in the host: the app already knows how to give a
//! program a pseudo-terminal, because that is what it does with IRIS.
//!
//! **The folder is the list.** Every shell the app offers is a `.toml` in
//! `<config>/plugins/shells/`, with no exceptions and nothing offered from a
//! table compiled into the binary. What the platform probes do is *write those
//! files*: the first time the app runs, the shells it finds installed are
//! materialised into the folder, each one a file that can then be renamed,
//! re-armed with different arguments, or deleted like any other.
//!
//! Deleting one makes it stay deleted. A stamp file records which programs have
//! ever been written, so a probe never puts back a file the user removed - and
//! a shell installed *after* that first run is still picked up, because its
//! program is not in the stamp yet.
